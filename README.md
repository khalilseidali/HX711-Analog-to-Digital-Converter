# HX711-Analog-to-Digital-Converter
HX711 - ADC Altium Library &amp; 2 Input Channels Design-(Reverse engineering)


HX711 is Based on Avia Semiconductor’s patented technology.  is a precision 24-bit analogto-digital converter (ADC) designed for weigh scales and industrial control applications to interface directly with a bridge sensor.The input multiplexer selects either Channel A or B differential input to the low-noise programmable gain amplifier (PGA). Channel A can be programmed with a gain of 128 or 64, corresponding to a full-scale differential input voltage of ±20mV or ±40mV respectively, when
a 5V supply is connected to AVDD analog power supply pin. Channel B has a fixed gain of 32. Onchip power supply regulator eliminates the need for an external supply regulator to provide analog power for the ADC and the sensor.


APPLICATIONS :
• Two selectable differential input channels

• On-chip active low noise PGA with selectable gain
of 32, 64 and 128

• On-chip power supply regulator for load-cell and
ADC analog power supply

• On-chip oscillator requiring no external
component with optional external crystal

• On-chip power-on-reset

• Simple digital control and serial interface:
pin-driven controls, no programming needed

• Selectable 10SPS or 80SPS output data rate

• Simultaneous 50 and 60Hz supply rejection

• Current consumption including on-chip analog
power supply regulator:
 normal operation < 1.5mA, power down < 1uA

• Operation supply voltage range: 2.6 ~ 5.5V

• Operation temperature range: -40 ~ +85℃

• 16 pin SOP-16 package
